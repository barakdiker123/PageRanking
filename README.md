# PageRanking Algorithm 
Have you ever wonder how the google search algorithm works ?? 
The google search engine is based on a paper written by sergey brin and Larry Page 
which employ linear algebra tools search as diagonalization and probablity to Rank The pages of the World Wide Web 
WWW for short 

This git repo contain some cool animation and a 15 minutes 
presentation about the google's Pageranking algo 

I've also attached some paper written by google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page 

This topic is also heavily related to Chess Scoring but sadly I didn't finished that slide 
so I'll talk about PageRanking ,Markov Chain ,Argodic Theorem ,Perron Frobenius Theorem 


Here are some of the slides that I'll present

## How to view ? 
The presentation has been written with the revealjs framework 
one should install revealjs before trying to run it !

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/barakdiker123/PageRanking
